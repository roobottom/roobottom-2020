This weekend we started a new project: exploring our home county, Sussex. Roo (almost four) is probably a bit too young to grasp what we're doing entirely. But it's fun and won't break the bank — the ideal recipe for quality family time. 

For our first outing, we choose Lewes. It's a pretty mid-sized town northeast of Brighton. History abounds and makes the place feel like a film set — not least the timber-framed "Fifteenth Century" bookshop. The old castle walls and gates weave their way through the town; modern fused with ancient.

After lunch, we paid to explore the castle. Although not hugely expensive, it could get costly for a bigger family. There was plenty of stuff for Roo to do. Dressing up didn't appeal but climbing the steep steps of various towers was exciting enough.

The best thing about the castle is the views. From the top of the Keep, you can see for miles. It suddenly poured with rain as we emerged at the top, but I did manage to capture this quick shot.

Lewes is fascinating, and we wanted to explore more. Alas, it was tea time, so we headed home to sate the child.
