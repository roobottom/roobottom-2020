A paragraph of text can contain both **bold** and *italic* elements, and sometimes **_bold-italic_** elements. Paragraphs also sometimes contain [links](http://roobottom.com) to other interesting content.

"Paragraphs that start with quotes", he said, "have punctuation that hangs".

09.12" fl fi ffi ffl. _09.12" fl fi ffi ffl_ **09.12" fl fi ffi ffl** **_09.12" fl fi ffi ffl_**

## h2. Expect skilled signwriters to use many jazzy, quaint old alphabets effectively. 09.12" fl fi ffi ffl
### h3. The wizard quickly jinxed the gnomes before they vaporized. 10.54" fl fi ffi ffl

**Bulleted lists** are great! Here’s one:

+ The first item
+ The second item
	+ The first child of the second item
		+ The first child of the first child of the second item
	+ The second child of the second item
+ The third item

Don’t forget about **numbered lists**, here’s one:

1. The first item
1. The second item
	1. The first child of the second item
		1. The first child of the first child of the second item
	1. The second child of the second item
1. The third item

> Quotes are great too! When someone else has said something, use a quote! —[Attributed to someone.](#)

Sometimes its important to mention a `variable` or other `code element`, inline. Other times, its better to show a whole block of code, like this:

```
.class-name {
  color: blue;
}
```

If you have tabular data, you might just want to use a table element to represent said data, much like this:

Place | Size | Price
--- | --- | ---
Moon base Alpha6 | 3 Million m^3^ | €1,986
Brian's hotel and spa | 1,872 m^3^ | €2,872,972

Sometimes you might wish to abbreviate something, like CSS.
