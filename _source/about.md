Hello. Thank you for taking the time for visiting my website. My name is Jon and I love making stuff for the web. 

I also like writing. So that's what I do here. I write short article about the things in my life. Usually that involves my wife Katie and our two children (who I call Roo and Rootwo).

This website isn't really for anyone else. But occasionally I'll write about web development, sport or politics. Others might find some interest there.

In general though, I maintain this site simply because I like building stuff for the web.
