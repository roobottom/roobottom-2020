This morning we were sure that RooTwo had Covid; we'd convinced ourselves of it. Anything with milk would make him vomit. His nose was runny. He was a floppy mess on the sofa. Yesterday, we all got PCR tests as RooTwo's LFT had been positive; what a wild experience that was! Roo was brave but I felt horrible sticking the swab in her throat as tears rolled down her cheeks. RooTwo screamed and said later "Daddy hurt nose". 

We'd had a subdued Sunday morning. Later — when RooTwo had a nap — Roo and I cycled to the beach. And, oh, it felt good to be outside. We managed a little bit of excavation before the rain came. Then it was a quick cycle home to change.

While Katie sorted the kingsize basket of washing I played with the kids in the garden. "We're all negative!" called Katie "I just got the text". Just like that our week was saved.
