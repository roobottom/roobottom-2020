Today was strange. The weather was horrible and my foot still hurt so I skipped Park Run. Later, Roo and I headed out to do some shopping for Mummy's birthday gift. I treated her to a hot chocolate and gingerbread man in Costa.

The big plan _had_ been Rootwo's big birthday bash at [Little Street](https://www.little-street.co.uk/). Instead, we celebrated his birthday with PCR tests all around.

We did a LFT on the boy pre-party, never thinking it would be positive, but, blow my socks off, it only bloody was!

Little Street was amazing; they let all our friends attend as well as offering us a free party later in the year. Maybe three is the magic number and he'll get a party in 2022.
